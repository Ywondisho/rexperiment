This is the first R MarkDown Document we created at CGC under the guidance of Jeff
The file contains technique of creating document with R code 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Introduction
Welcome to R MarkDown trainig session. This session of the training will help trainees to undertand the basics of R MarkDown and how it is useful for Data Science.

## Overview
This training is important to generate **documents** with required formatting.
The settings are automatically included 

### Specific Objectives
The specific objective is to look into different *formatting* techniques to produce standard documents as a report. The technique will allow R codes to be integrated and generate the required result. 

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3

Here is a simple data frame: 

```{r}
set.seed(1)
library(tibble)
plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000, sd = .5),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000)
)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()
